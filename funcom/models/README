These are the actual model implementations.

To add a new model, do the following:

1) Create a model Python file with the format/functions as the other model files.  For experimental models, please use the convention [yourname][number].py.  This filename should also serve as the "modeltype" parameter to the scripts, and is appended to saved trained models and prediction output.

2) Edit model.py in the funcom/ directory to include your model name in the "if" block, and of course import your model.
